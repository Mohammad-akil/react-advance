              the Site's database by contacting us via the information provided
              in this Privacy Policy, as well as to direct any of the
              third-party service providers which assist us with our Site
              operations or other services we may offer to delete/deactivate
              Personally Identifiable Information held by them which was
              originally received by them from us. However, because of backups
              and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a
              Visitor's entry without retaining some residual information. An
              individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable
              Information deactivated will have this information functionally
              deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally
              Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way
              moving forward.
